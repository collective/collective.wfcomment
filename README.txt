Introduction
============

This package installs a JavaScript handler (using jQuery) that will present
a prompt box inviting the user to enter a comment before triggering a workflow
transition from the 'state' drop-down in a standard Plone site.

The handler will only be used for workflow actions using the standard
`content_status_modify` script.
